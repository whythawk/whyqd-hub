# Your privacy and data rights

Whyqd.com ("our site" or "this site") is owned and operated by [Whythawk](https://whythawk.com), a data science consultancy specialising in open data and open access research.

Whythawk works in the field of data transparency and accountability. We care very much about the privacy and security of our users, and believe that personal privacy is critical for trust between ourselves and those who use our services. We expect similar consideration from the users of our site.

Please read these site terms of use and privacy policy carefully before using our site. By using our site, you automatically agree to all of these terms. Whythawk may revise these terms from time to time. If you continue to use our site after we post changes to these terms, it will mean that you accept those changes.

We hope these terms cover everything you need to know, but if you still have any questions please feel free to [contact us](/contact-us).

## Your data and research

You, or the original licensors, retain ownership of any data uploaded to Whyqd.com as part of your use of this site. These materials may include, without limitation, quantitative data, text, images, or graphics. Your use of this site in no way grants Whythawk, or Whyqd.com, the right to use or re-use your data **except** for the limited and specific purpose of supporting management and transformation of your data.

You also declare that any and all data uploaded to this site are:

- your own, or that you possess all necessary rights to upload these materials to this site,
- do not, and will not, infringe, missappropriate, use or disclose without appropriate authorisation, or violate any intellectual property or proprietary right of any other party,
- not unlawful, fraudulent, threatening, abusive, libelous, defamatory, obscene or otherwise unethical.

This site should not be treated as an online storage service or repository for long-term custody of your research data. You are responsible for the secure storage and distribution of your data.

You are in control of what is stored on Whyqd.com. No dialogs or popups will ask to confirm your actions. There is no `undo` button. All deletions - whether of data, schemas, crosswalks or anything else - are instant, and permanent.

## Your email address

As with any other email, any and all email addresses sent to us as a result of correspondence, or saved as a consequence of you creating anaccount, results in us holding your email address and, if provided, your name, along with the content of your message.

Your email address will not be used or collected for the purposes of reselling to a third party and will not be added to a bulk emailing list.

Should you sign up to Whyqd.com we will only send you emails relating to an alert you have signed up for, or for other reasons that you specifically authorise.

We will never give or sell your email addresses to anyone else, unless we are obliged to by law, or you ask us to.

## Your IP address

The IP address associated with your use of this site (which may or may not be sufficient to identify you, depending on circumstances), is recorded automatically to our logs. It will not normally be seen by anyone.

In addition to the information you may give us about yourself in order to use the site (such as your name and email address), we collect and log some additional information in order to analyse and fix problems with the site.

Our webserver logs maintain a history of page requests. This includes information about requests, including the client IP address, data submitted (which might include your email address when you log on to the site), request date and time, page requested, browser version and referrer. We routinely keep this information for 60 days. Note that in normal circumstances, these data are infrequently accessed by a human, and when it is, they are likely to be assessing it in bulk, in order to understand an issue with the site, rather than at a granular level of individual users.

We do not share IP addresses with anyone else unless required to by law (for example in the course of a police investigation for which a court order has been received).

We anonymise all IP addresses prior to saving any user activity logged for the express purpose of understanding and analysing your interaction with our content, and to share with stakeholders.

By way of example, if your IP address were '69.63.191.207', we first assess the location for that IP at the country level. After identifying this geography, we immediately redact the last octet to '69.63.191.0' and hash the result, yielding a random 24 digit code, such as 'T2V1kPkdNLQS5L9Ha2jIzvL3'.

This hashed code is then used to track user activity. Note: this IP hashing approach applies also to logged-in users. Your individual activity is never tracked.

## What we track

We track three things:

- The country where your IP address is based,
- The specific pages on this site which you visit,
- The `subject` topics you defined when uploading your data.

Our objective is to understand the type of data our users manage, as well as the geographic distribution of our users.

## Cookies and Advertising

We do not present advertising on this site and all content is served directly by our servers and is not referred via any third-parties. Neither do we use any form of in-browser tracking. For this reason, we only need to store cookies on your computer while you are logged in. Each cookie is just a random string of characters, and maintain your login state.

The cookies are there to protect your safety from fraudulent cross-site attacks (sometimes called 'man-in-the-middle' attacks). These cookies hold the token, and refresh token, required to maintain your login state.

No other cookies are presented by this site, and we do not host third-party trackers or advertisers.

## Your site membership

You are under no obligation to create an account or pay anything towards the upkeep and maintenance of this service. Should you choose to do so, and should you provide additional information about yourself, our access to that information will be subject to your ongoing consent.

You may withdraw your consent at any time and delete your account.

If you purchase any service or provide a financial contribution to this site then, as part of our company and fiduciary responsibilities, we will store details of your payment and indirectly associate this with your account. Such data will include your email address and actual IP address.

If you choose to withdraw consent and delete your account, note that you are also ending your membership and forfeiting any fees paid and benefits of that membership.

Deleting your account is irreversible.

## Legal basis for processing

In choosing to make use of this site, you are consenting to your data being processed as described on this page. The legal basis for processing your data, as a user of this site, is your consent as laid out in [6(1)(a) of the GDPR](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-6-gdpr/), in force from 25 May 2018.

## Your rights

You have the right to delete your account at any time. Doing so will automatically delete everything we know about you.

You have the right to know what personal data we hold about you. If you have an account and are logged in, everything we know will always be presented on your profile page. If you do not have an account, we do not know anything about you as an individual and hold no personal data on you.

You have the right to complain if you believe that we have mishandled your personal data. The relevant supervisory body is the [Commission Nationale de l'Informatique et des Libertés](https://www.cnil.fr/). You can report a concern directly, but please contact us first, so that we may try and resolve your concern.
