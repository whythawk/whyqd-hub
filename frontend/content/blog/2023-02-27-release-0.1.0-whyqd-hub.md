# Release of Whyqd Hub 0.1.0

_Gavin Chait, 27 February 2023_

**whyqd** provides an intuitive method for schema-to-schema data transforms for research data reuse, and for restructuring ugly data to conform to a standardised metadata schema. It supports data managers and researchers looking to rapidly, and continuously, ensure schema interoperability for tabular data using a simple series of steps. Once complete, you can import wrangled data into more complex analytical systems or full-feature wrangling tools.

You can already use the [**whyqd** Python distribution](https://github.com/whythawk/whyqd), and today marks the release of this Whyqd Hub platform for 'no-code' data and team management for data science.

- Released Whyqd Hub on [Github](https://github.com/whythawk/whyqd-hub) licensed under the terms of the [GUN Affero General Public License](https://github.com/whythawk/whyqd/blob/master/LICENSE).

We will be at [Research Data Alliance's 20th Plenary](https://www.rd-alliance.org/rdas-20th-plenary-draft-programme-0) in Gothenburg from 20 to 24 March. If you're going to be there and would like to meet, please [contact us](/contact).

Until next time, let's go have some coffee.
